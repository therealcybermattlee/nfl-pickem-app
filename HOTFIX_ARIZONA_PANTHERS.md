# HOTFIX: Arizona Cardinals vs Carolina Panthers Game Correction

**Date:** September 10, 2025  
**Issue:** Critical data integrity bug in Week 2 games  
**Status:** RESOLVED ✅

## Problem Description

Game ID `401772730` in Week 2 was incorrectly showing "Arizona Cardinals vs Arizona Cardinals" instead of the correct matchup "Carolina Panthers at Arizona Cardinals".

**Root Cause:** Both `homeTeamId` and `awayTeamId` were set to the same Arizona Cardinals team ID (`cmf3dg23w0000dqxuraqk16ls`) during ESPN API data synchronization.

## Investigation Results

**Database Query Revealed:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM games WHERE id = '401772730';
-- Result: homeTeamId = awayTeamId = 'cmf3dg23w0000dqxuraqk16ls' (Arizona Cardinals)
```

**ESPN API Confirmed Correct Matchup:**
```bash
curl "https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/football/nfl/scoreboard?seasontype=2&week=2&dates=2025"
# Result: "Carolina Panthers at Arizona Cardinals"
# ESPN Team IDs: Panthers (29), Cardinals (22)
```

## Resolution Applied

**Database Fix Executed:**
```sql
UPDATE games 
SET awayTeamId = 'cmf3dg2460004dqxu9p71zz8l' 
WHERE id = '401772730';
```

**Team ID Mapping:**
- Arizona Cardinals: `cmf3dg23w0000dqxuraqk16ls` (home team - correct)
- Carolina Panthers: `cmf3dg2460004dqxu9p71zz8l` (away team - corrected)

## Validation Results

**Post-Fix Verification:**
```sql
SELECT g.id, ht.name as home_team, at.name as away_team 
FROM games g 
JOIN teams ht ON g.homeTeamId = ht.id 
JOIN teams at ON g.awayTeamId = at.id 
WHERE g.id = '401772730';
```

**Result:** ✅ Arizona Cardinals vs Carolina Panthers (correct)

**Week 2 Integrity Check:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM games 
WHERE week = 2 AND season = 2025 AND homeTeamId = awayTeamId;
```

**Result:** ✅ 0 duplicate team ID games found
