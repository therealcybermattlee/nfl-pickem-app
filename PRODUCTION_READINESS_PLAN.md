# NFL Pick'em App - Production Readiness Plan

## Executive Summary
This plan outlines a 12-day (6 x 2-day units) production readiness sprint to deploy the complete time-lock pick system with comprehensive testing and validation.

**Critical Rule:** No feature will be declared "operational" without Playwright end-to-end testing validation.

## Current State Assessment

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- Database migration deployed with time-lock fields
- Basic API endpoints operational (games, teams, picks)
- ESPN integration with 199+ games loaded
- Frontend code complete but not deployed
- All 6 time-lock sprints code complete

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues to Resolve
- npm cache permission errors blocking installations
- Worker missing time-lock endpoints in production
- Frontend not deployed to Cloudflare Pages
- No Playwright tests validating user journeys
- Documentation needs updates

### üéØ Architecture Decision
**NO major architecture changes** - Work within existing Vite + React + Cloudflare Workers stack
