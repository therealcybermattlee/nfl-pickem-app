# NFL Pick'em Real-Time API Documentation

## Sprint 4: Real-Time Integration - API Reference

This document describes the real-time event system implemented for the NFL Pick'em application using Cloudflare Workers and D1 database.

## Overview

The real-time system provides live updates for:
- Game locks (when picks are no longer allowed)
- Score updates during games
- Pick submissions by users
- Auto-generated picks for missed deadlines
- Game completions and final scores
- Leaderboard changes

## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers with D1 SQLite database
- **Real-time**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) with polling fallback
- **Event Storage**: Temporary events table with automatic cleanup
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens for user-specific events

### Event Flow
1. Events are created and stored in `events` table
2. SSE clients receive real-time updates via streaming
3. Polling clients can fetch events since last known event ID
4. Events automatically expire after 1 hour and are cleaned up

## API Endpoints

### Real-Time Event Streaming

#### GET `/api/events/stream`
Server-Sent Events endpoint for real-time updates.

**Headers:**
- `Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>` (optional - for user-specific events)

    ],
    "triggeredBy": "game_completed",
    "updatedAt": "2025-09-07T21:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Event Scopes

Events can have different scopes:
- `global`: Visible to all users
- `user:123`: Visible only to user with ID 123

User-specific events are only sent to authenticated connections with matching user ID.

## Client Implementation

### JavaScript SSE Client

```javascript
const eventSource = new EventSource('/api/events/stream');

eventSource.onmessage = function(event) {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    handleRealTimeEvent(data);
};

eventSource.addEventListener('GameLockEvent', function(event) {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    showGameLockNotification(data);
});
```

### Polling Fallback

```javascript
async function pollForEvents(lastEventId) {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/events/poll?lastEventId=${lastEventId}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    
    data.events.forEach(event => {
        handleRealTimeEvent(event);
    });
    
    return data.lastEventId;
}
```

### React Hook

```javascript
import { useRealTimeUpdates } from './hooks/useRealTimeUpdates';

function MyComponent() {
    const {
        events,
        isConnected,
        getEventsByType
    } = useRealTimeUpdates({
        userId: currentUser.id,
        authToken: userToken
    });
    
    const gameLockEvents = getEventsByType('GameLockEvent');
    
    return (
        <div>
            <ConnectionStatus isConnected={isConnected} />
            <GameLockNotifications events={gameLockEvents} />
        </div>
    );
}
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. Open `test-realtime.html` in browser
2. Click "Connect SSE" to establish real-time connection
3. Use test buttons to create events
4. Observe real-time updates in the events panel

### Production Testing

```bash
# Test SSE endpoint
curl -N -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  "https://nfl-pickem-app-production.cybermattlee-llc.workers.dev/api/events/stream"

# Test polling endpoint
curl "https://nfl-pickem-app-production.cybermattlee-llc.workers.dev/api/events/poll?lastEventId=0"

# Create test event
curl -X POST "https://nfl-pickem-app-production.cybermattlee-llc.workers.dev/api/events" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type":"GameLockEvent","payload":{"gameId":"test","lockTime":"2025-09-07T18:00:00Z","teamsAffected":{"homeTeam":{"id":"KC","name":"Kansas City Chiefs","abbreviation":"KC"},"awayTeam":{"id":"BUF","name":"Buffalo Bills","abbreviation":"BUF"}}}}'
```

## Performance Considerations

- Events auto-expire after 1 hour to prevent database bloat
- Cleanup runs automatically during event creation (10% probability)
- SSE connections have heartbeat to detect disconnections
- Polling clients should use appropriate intervals (5-30 seconds)
- Maximum 50 events per request to avoid large responses

## Error Handling

- SSE connections automatically retry with exponential backoff
- Polling includes fallback for network errors
- Invalid JWT tokens result in anonymous (global events only) access
- Database errors return empty event arrays with error logging

## Security

- JWT authentication for user-specific events
- Event scopes prevent unauthorized access to user data
- Rate limiting should be implemented for event creation endpoint
- Events contain no sensitive information beyond user IDs

## Production Deployment

The real-time system is deployed as part of the main Cloudflare Workers application:

```bash
npx wrangler deploy --config wrangler-workers.toml --env production
```

Events table and indexes are automatically created in the D1 database.
