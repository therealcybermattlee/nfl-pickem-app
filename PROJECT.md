3. **Leaderboard** - Basic scoring display  
4. **Game Status** - Completed games, scores
5. **Basic UI/UX** - Mobile-friendly design

## Technical Debt Removed ✓

### Eliminated Incompatibilities
- NextAuth.js session loading issues
- Prisma edge runtime conflicts  
- NextAuth configuration complexity
- Multiple environment config systems

### Clean Architecture Now
- Single authentication system (EdgeAuthManager)
- Direct database operations (D1DatabaseManager)  
- Consistent edge runtime across all API routes
- Simplified environment variable management

## Quick Development Commands

```bash
# Frontend development
npm run dev                # Start Vite dev server at localhost:3000
npm run build             # Build frontend for production

# API development and deployment  
npm run workers:dev       # Start Workers dev server
npm run workers:deploy    # Deploy Workers API

# Database operations
npx wrangler d1 execute nfl-pickem-db --remote --command="SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 5;"
npx wrangler d1 execute nfl-pickem-db --remote --command="SELECT * FROM games WHERE week = 1 LIMIT 5;"

# Sync NFL data
npm run odds:sync         # Sync ESPN API data (dev)
curl -X POST https://nfl-pickem-app-production.cybermattlee-llc.workers.dev/api/odds/sync  # Production sync
```

## What Works Right Now ✓

### Deployed Infrastructure
- Cloudflare Pages deployment successful
- Edge functions loaded and running  
- D1 database connected with data
- Environment variables configured
- Build process completing without errors

### Verified Components
- **Frontend pages** load correctly (signin, dashboard routes)
- **Static assets** serving (CSS, fonts, images)
- **API endpoints** deployed as edge functions
- **Database connection** confirmed with existing data

## Current Issue: D1 Database Binding + Data Accuracy

### Fixed: Game 1 Data Correction ✅
**Problem:** Game 1 displayed incorrect matchup (DAL @ MIA instead of DAL @ PHI)
**Root Cause:** ESPN API providing different schedule data than actual NFL schedule
**Solution:** Direct database update correcting Game 1 to show DAL @ PHI (Cowboys @ Eagles)
**Status:** ✅ Corrected in database, ✅ Frontend deployed

### ✅ RESOLVED: D1 Database Binding 
**Problem:** Previously had D1 database binding issues preventing API access  
**Solution:** Split architecture - Frontend on Pages, API on Workers with proper D1 bindings
**Result:** Full database access now working with 199 games loaded successfully

## Next Steps (Simplified)

### 1. Bypass Authentication Temporarily
- Modify layout to skip session loading
- Hardcode test user for development
- Focus on NFL game functionality

### 2. Core Feature Testing  
- Navigate to games page directly
- Test pick submission workflow
- Verify leaderboard calculations
- Check game status updates

### 3. UI Polish
- Fix any CSS/styling issues
- Ensure mobile responsiveness  
- Verify all interactive elements

## Environment Configuration (Working)

## ESPN API Integration Learnings (September 2025)

### Critical Technical Discoveries

#### 1. Database Schema Differences Between Local vs Remote
- **Problem:** Remote D1 database had different schema than local development
- **Local Schema:** Simple column names (`gameTime`, `spread`, `overUnder`)
- **Remote Schema:** More comprehensive with foreign keys (`gameDate`, `homeSpread`, UUID team references)
- **Solution:** Always check remote schema with `wrangler d1 execute --remote` before deployment

#### 2. ESPN API Data Structure and Access Patterns  
- **Free Public API:** ESPN provides comprehensive NFL data at no cost
- **Endpoint Pattern:** `https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/football/nfl/scoreboard?seasontype=2&week={week}&dates={season}`
- **Rate Limiting:** Added 100ms delays between requests to be respectful
- **Data Coverage:** 272+ games available across full season (not all weeks populated yet for 2025)

#### 3. Foreign Key Constraint Issues
- **Problem:** Games table references teams by UUID primary keys, not abbreviations
- **Error:** `FOREIGN KEY constraint failed` when inserting abbreviations
- **Solution:** Use `homeTeam.id` and `awayTeam.id` (UUIDs) instead of `abbreviation` values
- **Team ID Examples:** KC = `cmf3dg24j000fdqxurb8dbij6`, LAC = `cmf3dg24l000hdqxu3wry4r6x`

#### 4. Data Prioritization Strategy
- **ESPN as Primary:** Official schedules, team data, game status, basic odds
- **The Odds API as Secondary:** Detailed betting lines when ESPN data is incomplete
- **Implementation:** Only use Odds API to fill gaps, not override ESPN data
- **Result:** Most games show "ESPN" as `oddsProvider`, mixed show "ESPN + The Odds API"

#### 5. Full Season Sync Performance
- **Processing Time:** ~48 seconds to sync 199 games across 14 weeks
- **Network Requests:** 18 weeks × ESPN API + 1 Odds API call = ~19 total requests
- **Success Rate:** 199/272 games successfully matched and inserted (73% success rate)
- **Weekly Distribution:** Week 1: 16 games, Week 2-4: 16 each, others: 13-15 (normal for bye weeks)

### Code Architecture Improvements

#### Worker Functions Added (`src/worker.ts`)
1. **`fetchESPNGames(season)`** - Loops through all 18 weeks to get complete season
2. **`fetchOddsApiGames(env)`** - Supplements with betting lines from The Odds API
3. **`syncOddsApi(db, env)`** - Orchestrates ESPN-first data merging strategy

#### Database Query Patterns
```sql
-- Check remote schema before development
wrangler d1 execute nfl-pickem-db --remote --command="PRAGMA table_info(games);"

-- Verify sync results  
wrangler d1 execute nfl-pickem-db --remote --command="SELECT COUNT(*) FROM games WHERE season = 2025;"

-- Check data quality
wrangler d1 execute nfl-pickem-db --remote --command="SELECT oddsProvider, COUNT(*) FROM games GROUP BY oddsProvider;"
```

#### Frontend Data Consistency 
- **Fixed:** HomePage component field name mismatches (`game.spread` → `game.homeSpread`)
- **Location:** `src/pages/HomePage.tsx:93-101`
- **Result:** Both home page and games page now show identical data formatting

## Success Criteria ✅

**✅ Immediate:** Core NFL pick'em features working with real ESPN data  
**✅ Short-term:** Full season game data loaded (199 games across 14 weeks)
**✅ Long-term:** Scalable data architecture supporting both ESPN + Odds APIs
