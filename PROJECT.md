# NFL Pick'em App - Project Status

## Current State: Cloudflare-Native Implementation 

**Date:** September 2025  
**Status:** Core rewrite complete, testing phase  
**Focus:** Get basic functionality working, skip authentication complexity  

## What We Built (Current Cloudflare-Native Stack)

### ✓ Core Architecture Rebuilt for Edge Runtime
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 with App Router (edge-compatible)
- **Authentication:** Custom JWT with Web Crypto API (EdgeAuthManager)
- **Database:** Direct D1 operations (replaced Prisma)
- **Deployment:** Cloudflare Pages with proper edge functions
- **UI:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (retained)

### ✓ Key Technical Migrations Completed
- **Removed NextAuth.js** → Custom JWT authentication  
- **Removed Prisma ORM** → Direct D1 database operations
- **Added bcryptjs** → Password verification compatibility
- **Updated API routes** → All edge runtime compatible
- **Fixed environment setup** → NEXTAUTH_SECRET configured in Cloudflare

### ✓ Database Integration
- **D1 Database ID:** `b85129d8-b27c-4c73-bd34-5314a881394b`
- **Schema:** Existing tables from previous setup (users, teams, games, picks)
- **Test User:** `test@example.com` already exists in database
- **Teams:** All 32 NFL teams populated

## Current Deployment

**Production URL:** https://ff0a32da.nfl-pickem-app.pages.dev  
**Custom Domain:** https://pickem.leefamilysso.com (configured in wrangler.toml)

## Immediate Focus - Skip Authentication Complexity

### Authentication Strategy: Cloudflare-Native Only
- Simplified to Cloudflare-native authentication (removed Microsoft OAuth)
- Uses JWT tokens with bcrypt password hashing  
- Clean credential-based login system
- Focus on core NFL functionality with simple auth

### Core Features to Verify (Priority Order)
1. **NFL Game Data Display** - Show current week games
2. **Pick Submission** - Users can select teams
3. **Leaderboard** - Basic scoring display  
4. **Game Status** - Completed games, scores
5. **Basic UI/UX** - Mobile-friendly design

## Technical Debt Removed ✓

### Eliminated Incompatibilities
- NextAuth.js session loading issues
- Prisma edge runtime conflicts  
- NextAuth configuration complexity
- Multiple environment config systems

### Clean Architecture Now
- Single authentication system (EdgeAuthManager)
- Direct database operations (D1DatabaseManager)  
- Consistent edge runtime across all API routes
- Simplified environment variable management

## Quick Development Commands

```bash
# Build and deploy
npm run build
npx wrangler pages deploy

# Database operations  
npx wrangler d1 execute nfl-pickem-db --remote --command="SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 5;"
npx wrangler d1 execute nfl-pickem-db --remote --command="SELECT * FROM teams LIMIT 10;"
npx wrangler d1 execute nfl-pickem-db --remote --command="SELECT * FROM games LIMIT 5;"

# Check environment
npx wrangler pages secret list --env production
```

## What Works Right Now ✓

### Deployed Infrastructure
- Cloudflare Pages deployment successful
- Edge functions loaded and running  
- D1 database connected with data
- Environment variables configured
- Build process completing without errors

### Verified Components
- **Frontend pages** load correctly (signin, dashboard routes)
- **Static assets** serving (CSS, fonts, images)
- **API endpoints** deployed as edge functions
- **Database connection** confirmed with existing data

## Current Issue: Session Loading Loop

**Problem:** Frontend gets stuck in "Loading..." due to session API 500 errors  
**Root Cause:** Minor config mismatch between new auth system and existing database schema  
**Solution:** Bypass authentication for core functionality testing

## Next Steps (Simplified)

### 1. Bypass Authentication Temporarily
- Modify layout to skip session loading
- Hardcode test user for development
- Focus on NFL game functionality

### 2. Core Feature Testing  
- Navigate to games page directly
- Test pick submission workflow
- Verify leaderboard calculations
- Check game status updates

### 3. UI Polish
- Fix any CSS/styling issues
- Ensure mobile responsiveness  
- Verify all interactive elements

## Environment Configuration (Working)

```bash
# Cloudflare environment variables set:
NEXTAUTH_SECRET: ✓ Configured
NODE_ENV: production  
NEXTAUTH_URL: https://pickem.leefamilysso.com
CURRENT_NFL_SEASON: 2025
CURRENT_NFL_WEEK: 1
```

## File Structure (Current)

```

## Success Criteria 

**Immediate:** Core NFL pick'em features working without authentication barriers  
**Short-term:** Full user flow from games → picks → leaderboard  
**Long-term:** Microsoft OAuth integration for production users  

---

**Development Philosophy:** Get the NFL functionality working first, perfect the authentication later. Users care about making picks and seeing scores, not login complexity.
