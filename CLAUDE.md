# NFL Pick'em App - Claude Development Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES - READ FIRST! ‚ö†Ô∏è

### ü§ñ Primary Assistant Configuration
**ALWAYS USE CLAUDE SONNET 4 as the primary model** - This provides the best balance of capability, speed, and cost for development tasks.

### üöÄ BE PROACTIVE WITH SPECIALIZED AGENTS  
**ALWAYS try to use specialized agents instead of doing work yourself** when applicable:

- **frontend-developer**: Build React components, implement responsive layouts, and handle client-side state management. Optimizes frontend performance and ensures accessibility. Use PROACTIVELY when creating UI components or fixing frontend issues.
- **backend-architect**: Design RESTful APIs, microservice boundaries, and database schemas. Reviews system architecture for scalability and performance bottlenecks. Use PROACTIVELY when creating new backend services or APIs.
- **ui-ux-designer**: Create interface designs, wireframes, and design systems. Masters user research, prototyping, and accessibility standards. Use PROACTIVELY for design systems, user flows, or interface optimization.
- **typescript-pro**: Master TypeScript with advanced types, generics, and strict type safety. Handles complex type systems, decorators, and enterprise-grade patterns. Use PROACTIVELY for TypeScript architecture, type inference optimization, or advanced typing patterns.
- **deployment-engineer**: Configure CI/CD pipelines, Docker containers, and cloud deployments. Handles GitHub Actions, Kubernetes, and infrastructure automation. Use PROACTIVELY when setting up deployments, containers, or CI/CD workflows.
- **code-reviewer**: Expert code review specialist. Proactively reviews code for quality, security, and maintainability. Use immediately after writing or modifying code.
- **architect-review**: Reviews code changes for architectural consistency and patterns. Use PROACTIVELY after any structural changes, new services, or API modifications. Ensures SOLID principles, proper layering, and maintainability.
- **api-documenter**: Create OpenAPI/Swagger specs, generate SDKs, and write developer documentation. Handles versioning, examples, and interactive docs. Use PROACTIVELY for API documentation or client library generation.
- **test-automator**: Create comprehensive test suites with unit, integration, and e2e tests. Sets up CI pipelines, mocking strategies, and test data. Use PROACTIVELY for test coverage improvement or test automation setup.
- **general-purpose**: General-purpose agent for researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries use this agent to perform the search for you.

**Why?** Specialized agents have focused expertise and can often solve problems more efficiently than general development approaches.

### üìã Task Management
- **ALWAYS use TodoWrite** for any multi-step or complex tasks
- Track progress transparently for the user
- Break down large tasks into manageable steps

## CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT LEARNINGS - READ FIRST! ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Essential Development Principles (Based on Real Experience)

**FAVOR DESTRUCTIVE, LONG-TERM FIXES OVER QUICK FIXES**
- Quick fixes and workarounds should be LAST RESORT only
- When facing architectural problems, choose the destructive but proper solution
- Rewrite entire systems if they're fundamentally incompatible
- Remove and replace broken dependencies completely rather than patching
- Example: Replace NextAuth + Prisma entirely for Cloudflare compatibility rather than trying to make them work

**NEVER declare anything "fixed" until the USER can verify it works in the actual UI**
- Testing individual API endpoints ‚â† Testing complete user experience
- Always verify the full user journey: login ‚Üí dashboard ‚Üí games display ‚Üí picks functionality
- Use Playwright for end-to-end testing, not curl for API-only testing
- When user reports "it doesn't work" - believe them, don't dismiss their feedback

**Always test the DEPLOYED APPLICATION that users actually access**
- Local development ‚â† Production deployment
- Different deployment URLs may serve different versions
- Check what's actually deployed vs what's in source code
- Verify the correct production URL is being updated

**Be brutally honest about uncertainty**
- Say "I'm not sure, let me check" instead of claiming false confidence
- Admit when something failed instead of making excuses
- Don't make promises until you have concrete evidence
- If you can't verify something works, say so explicitly

**Focus on the complete application, not isolated components**
- Ensure all features are present: dashboard, games list, picks, stats, authentication
- Verify the rich UI components are deployed, not just basic pages
- Check that the app matches the described functionality in this document
- Don't deploy stripped/incomplete versions

**Listen to user feedback and act on it immediately**
- If user says "this is wrong" or "this doesn't work" - investigate thoroughly
- Don't continue with other tasks until core issues are resolved
- User experience is the only measure that matters
- Take responsibility for mistakes instead of making excuses

### Deployment-Specific Learnings

**Cloudflare Pages Deployment Issues Encountered:**
- Multiple deployment URLs can exist with different content
- Main production domain: `https://nfl-pickem-app.pages.dev`
- Custom domain: `https://pickem.leefamilysso.com`
- Always verify which URL is the canonical production version
- Use `wrangler pages deploy` for proper deployments
- Check that functions are deployed to correct locations

**Build Process Must Capture Full Application:**
- Ensure Next.js build includes all pages and components
- Verify API routes are properly deployed
- Check that static assets and styling are included
- Don't accept basic/stripped versions as successful deployments

---

**Next Steps:** Ready to implement time-lock pick system using the 6-sprint plan. Foundation is solid and all core systems are operational.

**For New Developers:** This codebase is production-ready for basic pick'em functionality. The time-lock feature represents the next major milestone.

**REMEMBER:** Always follow the critical learnings above. User experience and honesty are more important than appearing competent.

## üîß CURRENT TECHNICAL BLOCKERS (September 2025)

### D1 Database Binding Issue - PRIORITY 1

**Problem:** All API endpoints returning 500 errors due to D1 database binding not accessible in Cloudflare Pages edge functions.

**Status:** Architecture complete, configuration issue only

**What Works:**
- ‚úÖ D1 database exists with ID `b85129d8-b27c-4c73-bd34-5314a881394b`
- ‚úÖ Database contains all 32 NFL teams and test users
- ‚úÖ API routes converted to edge runtime
- ‚úÖ D1DatabaseManager with all necessary methods
- ‚úÖ Build and deployment process working
- ‚úÖ Environment variables configured (NEXTAUTH_SECRET)

**What's Broken:**
- ‚ùå D1 binding access: `(globalThis as any).DB` and `process.env.DB` both undefined
- ‚ùå All API endpoints return 500: `/api/teams`, `/api/games`, `/api/picks`
- ‚ùå Frontend stuck in "Loading..." due to failed session API calls

**Technical Root Cause:**
In Cloudflare Pages with Next.js, D1 bindings are accessed differently than in standard Workers. Current implementation tries `request.cf?.env?.DB` and `globalThis.DB`, but neither work in the Pages environment.

**Next Steps for Resolution:**
1. ‚úÖ Implemented `getRequestContext()` from `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` approach
2. ‚úÖ Updated all API routes with proper binding access pattern
3. ‚ùå Production deployment still failing - `getRequestContext()` not working in Cloudflare Pages environment
4. **Alternative needed:** Switch to direct D1 REST API calls or different deployment approach

**Current Status:** All API endpoints return 500 errors in production, even simple test endpoints. The `getRequestContext()` approach works in documentation but fails in the actual Cloudflare Pages deployment environment.

**Impact:** Core NFL functionality is architecturally complete but completely blocked until D1 access is resolved.

**Deployment URLs:**
- Latest: `https://c16e8872.nfl-pickem-app.pages.dev`
- Custom domain: `https://pickem.leefamilysso.com` (configured in wrangler.toml)

### Authentication System - DEPRIORITIZED

**Status:** Functional but bypassed for testing core NFL features

**Decision:** Simplified to Cloudflare-native authentication only. Removed Microsoft OAuth complexity. Uses JWT + bcrypt for clean credential-based auth focused on core functionality.
