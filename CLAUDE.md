# NFL Pick'em App - Claude Development Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES - READ FIRST! ‚ö†Ô∏è

### ü§ñ Primary Assistant Configuration
**ALWAYS USE CLAUDE SONNET 4 as the primary model** - This provides the best balance of capability, speed, and cost for development tasks.

### üöÄ BE PROACTIVE WITH SPECIALIZED AGENTS - CRITICAL PRIORITY!
**ALWAYS use specialized agents instead of doing work yourself** when applicable - this is MANDATORY:

- **frontend-developer**: Build React components, implement responsive layouts, and handle client-side state management. Optimizes frontend performance and ensures accessibility. Use PROACTIVELY when creating UI components or fixing frontend issues. **RECENT SUCCESS**: Created complete leaderboard component with responsive design.
- **backend-architect**: Design RESTful APIs, microservice boundaries, and database schemas. Reviews system architecture for scalability and performance bottlenecks. Use PROACTIVELY when creating new backend services or APIs.
- **ui-ux-designer**: Create interface designs, wireframes, and design systems. Masters user research, prototyping, and accessibility standards. Use PROACTIVELY for design systems, user flows, or interface optimization.
- **typescript-pro**: Master TypeScript with advanced types, generics, and strict type safety. Handles complex type systems, decorators, and enterprise-grade patterns. Use PROACTIVELY for TypeScript architecture, type inference optimization, or advanced typing patterns.
- **deployment-engineer**: Configure CI/CD pipelines, Docker containers, and cloud deployments. Handles GitHub Actions, Kubernetes, and infrastructure automation. Use PROACTIVELY when setting up deployments, containers, or CI/CD workflows. **NEEDED FOR**: Cloudflare Cron triggers and automated scheduler implementation.
- **code-reviewer**: Expert code review specialist. Proactively reviews code for quality, security, and maintainability. Use immediately after writing or modifying code.
- **architect-review**: Reviews code changes for architectural consistency and patterns. Use PROACTIVELY after any structural changes, new services, or API modifications. Ensures SOLID principles, proper layering, and maintainability.
- **api-documenter**: Create OpenAPI/Swagger specs, generate SDKs, and write developer documentation. Handles versioning, examples, and interactive docs. Use PROACTIVELY for API documentation or client library generation.
- **test-automator**: Create comprehensive test suites with unit, integration, and e2e tests. Sets up CI pipelines, mocking strategies, and test data. Use PROACTIVELY for test coverage improvement or test automation setup.
- **general-purpose**: General-purpose agent for researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries use this agent to perform the search for you.

**Why?** Specialized agents have focused expertise and can often solve problems more efficiently than general development approaches.

**RULE: If the task matches an agent's specialty, use the agent immediately. Don't attempt the work manually first.**

### üö® NEVER TEST ON NON-PRODUCTION URLs üö®
**CRITICAL RULE - ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT:**
- **ALWAYS test fixes on the production site: https://pickem.cyberlees.dev**
- **NEVER test on preview URLs like *.pages.dev - they have different CORS configurations**
- **Preview URLs will mislead debugging and waste time**
- **If production isn't updating, investigate why production isn't updating**
- **Do not get sidetracked with preview deployments when production is the issue**

### üìã Task Management
- **ALWAYS use TodoWrite** for any multi-step or complex tasks
- Track progress transparently for the user
- Break down large tasks into manageable steps

### ‚úÖ PERMANENT TESTING RULE - MANDATORY
**NEVER call any feature "operational", "working", "deployed", or "ready" without confirming it through end-user testing with Playwright.**
- All features MUST be validated with actual browser automation tests
- Test the complete user journey, not just API endpoints
- Verify both desktop and mobile experiences
- Document test results before declaring success
- This rule applies to ALL deployments and feature releases

## üéØ ESPN API INTEGRATION SUCCESS (September 2025)

### RESOLVED: D1 Database Access ‚úÖ 

**Problem:** Previously had D1 database binding issues preventing API access
**Solution:** Switched to Cloudflare Workers deployment instead of Pages for API routes
**Result:** Full database access now working with 199 games loaded successfully

### ESPN API Integration - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Status:** Production-ready NFL data integration working

**What Works:**
- ‚úÖ ESPN API integration with 199 games across 14 weeks
- ‚úÖ Full season 2025 NFL schedule loaded  
- ‚úÖ All 16 Week 1 games properly synced
- ‚úÖ Real betting lines (spreads: -1.5, 5.5; over/unders: 47.5, 48.5)
- ‚úÖ Frontend data consistency fixed (home page = games page)
- ‚úÖ Workers API endpoints returning proper data
- ‚úÖ Sync performance: ~48 seconds for full season

**Production URLs:**
- **Workers API:** `https://nfl-pickem-app-production.cybermattlee-llc.workers.dev`
- **Custom Domain:** `https://pickem.cyberlees.dev` (configured in wrangler.toml)

### CRITICAL ESPN API LEARNINGS - MUST READ! 

**ALWAYS FAVOR OFFICIAL DATA SOURCES OVER THIRD-PARTY APIs**
- ESPN API is the authoritative source for NFL schedules, scores, team data
- Use The Odds API ONLY to supplement missing ESPN data, never to override it  
- Implementation: Check ESPN first, fill gaps with Odds API if needed
- Result: Most games tagged "ESPN", mixed sources tagged "ESPN + The Odds API"

**ALWAYS CHECK REMOTE DATABASE SCHEMA BEFORE CODING**  
- Local vs Remote D1 databases can have different schemas
- Command: `wrangler d1 execute nfl-pickem-db --remote --command="PRAGMA table_info(games);"`
- Critical Issue: Remote uses UUID foreign keys (`homeTeam.id`), not abbreviations
- Fix: Use `homeTeam.id` and `awayTeam.id` for INSERT operations, not `.abbreviation`

**FULL SEASON SYNC APPROACH IS OPTIMAL**
- Don't limit to single weeks - process entire season at once  
- ESPN API Pattern: Loop through weeks 1-18 with delays between requests
- Performance: ~48 seconds to sync 199 games across 14 weeks
- Success Rate: 73% match rate between ESPN and team database (199/272 games)

**ESPN API TECHNICAL DETAILS**
- Free Public Endpoint: `https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/football/nfl/scoreboard?seasontype=2&week={week}&dates={season}`
- Rate Limiting: Add 100ms delays between requests to be respectful
- Data Structure: `event.competitions[0].competitors` contains home/away teams
- Odds Access: `event.competitions[0].odds[0]` has spread and over/under when available

**FRONTEND DATA CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS**
- HomePage and Games page must use identical field names
- Critical Fields: `game.homeSpread` (not `game.spread`), `game.overUnder`
- Location: Always check `src/pages/HomePage.tsx` matches field names from API
- Validation: Compare both pages side-by-side in browser to verify consistency

### ESPN API Worker Implementation (`src/worker.ts`)

**Function Architecture:**
1. `fetchESPNGames(season)` - Primary data fetcher (loops through weeks 1-18)
2. `fetchOddsApiGames(env)` - Supplementary betting data
3. `syncOddsApi(db, env)` - Orchestrates ESPN-first merging strategy

**Sync Endpoint:** `POST /api/odds/sync` 
- Clears existing season data completely
- Processes all weeks from ESPN API
- Supplements with Odds API data for missing values
- Returns comprehensive stats: `{gamesInserted, weekBreakdown, dataSources}`

**Database Operations:**
```sql
-- Verify schema before development
wrangler d1 execute nfl-pickem-db --remote --command="PRAGMA table_info(games);"

-- Check sync results
wrangler d1 execute nfl-pickem-db --remote --command="SELECT COUNT(*) FROM games WHERE season = 2025 AND week = 1;"

-- Verify data sources
wrangler d1 execute nfl-pickem-db --remote --command="SELECT oddsProvider, COUNT(*) FROM games GROUP BY oddsProvider;"
```

**Key Success Metrics Achieved:**
- ‚úÖ Week 1: All 16 games loaded correctly
- ‚úÖ Full Season: 199 games across 14 weeks  
- ‚úÖ Data Quality: Real spreads (-1.5, 5.5) and over/unders (47.5, 48.5)
- ‚úÖ Performance: Complete season sync in under 1 minute
- ‚úÖ Consistency: Home page and games page show identical data

### Summary

**Current Status:** Production-ready NFL pick'em app  
**Architecture:** Modern, scalable, and fully Cloudflare-native  
**Next Steps:** Time-lock system implementation to complete core functionality
