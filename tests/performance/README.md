## 🏈 Real Game-Day Scenarios Tested

### 1. **Normal Family Usage** (10-25 users)
- Family members checking games and making picks
- Casual browsing and leaderboard checking
- **Target**: Smooth experience, < 500ms response times

### 2. **Game Day Morning Rush** (25-50 users)
- Multiple family members active simultaneously
- Reviewing spreads, making initial picks
- **Target**: Maintain performance under increased load

### 3. **Deadline Panic Rush** (50-100+ users)
- Final hour before games start
- Users frantically submitting multiple picks
- **Target**: System remains stable, picks process successfully

### 4. **Real-Time Game Monitoring**
- Live score updates and leaderboard changes
- Countdown timer accuracy during games
- **Target**: Real-time updates without performance loss

## 📊 Performance Targets

| Component | Metric | Target | Critical |
|-----------|--------|---------|----------|
| **API Response** | 95th percentile | < 500ms | < 1000ms |
| **Page Load** | Initial load | < 3s | < 5s |
| **Pick Submission** | Per pick | < 2s | < 3s |
| **Concurrent Users** | Peak load | 100+ | 50+ |
| **Error Rate** | Under load | < 1% | < 5% |
| **Timer Accuracy** | Countdown precision | ±1s | ±3s |
